Quick Lasagna Recipe

Ingredients:
- 12 lasagna noodles (uncooked)
- 1 lb (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage
- 1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce
- 1 container (15 oz) ricotta cheese
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- 2 cups fresh spinach (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
1) Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2) Cook Meat: In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat. Add the marinara sauce to the meat and stir well. Let it simmer for a few minutes, then remove from heat.
3) Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, half of the Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
4) Layer Lasagna: First Layer: Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Second Layer: Arrange 4 uncooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.
5) Repeat Layers: Repeat layers twice more (meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella).
6) Top Layer: Finish with a layer of meat sauce and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top.
7) Bake: Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent the top from burning) and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
8) Rest and Serve: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.
